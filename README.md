# Monty_Hall_Problem
A small project in c++ in which we decide once and for all if you should change the door

## The MONTY HALL PROBLEM
### What is the Monty Hall Problem?
In short the problem goes:

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

### Is there a solution?
We can not determine in which door the car is... BUT what we can do is determine the probability of in which door the car has the more chance to be.

Mathematically there is a 66.66% chance that if you change doors you'll get the car, and a 33.33% chance of getting it if you decide to stay... so... yeah you shoud change doors.

## Why prove it?
Even though there is a "solution" it is a very controversial topic and there are always mixed opinions on the matter. 

That's why we've decided to code a program in which you can test the monty hall problem all by yourself or simulate it as many times as you want, so that we do not only have mathematical proof but empirical proof as well.
